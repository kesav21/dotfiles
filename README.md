## vim

### colorscheme

I have a hard time deciding on a colorscheme for vim

- [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)
	- I used this for the longest time.
	- I love the theme, but there was just too much blue.
	- I am trying to reduce my exposure to blue light.
- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) (currently in use)
	- I recently switched to gruvbox.
	- I love the theme. I love the color palette.
	- I am currently in the process of making it my main theme.
- [Atom OneDark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)
	- I really like this theme, but found it's vim implementations lacking.
	- I tried out a few, but I didn't like any of the ones I came across.

### file manager

- [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
	- I don't really have any complaints.
	- I just don't use a project drawer a whole lot in vim.
- [vifm.vim](https://github.com/vifm/vifm.vim)
	- This is pretty cool.
	- It seems a little bit over the top for my purposes.
- netrw (currently in use)
	- This is the one I currently use.
	- This is the built-in file manager in vim.
	- I haven't used it a whole lot, but it seems acceptable so far.
	- I have heard that it has a lot of bugs, but I haven't had any problems with it yet.
	- This [article](https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/) convinced me to switch to netrw.
